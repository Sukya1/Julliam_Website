        <h2><i>Our Mission Statement</i></h2>
        <p>
            The Julliam center began as a small program with around five students and two teachers. Then and now our mission 
            remains the same - to improve the life of others through education. Today, this organization 
            provides jobs to teachers, colleges students and is a guide for many parents who choose to 
            home school their children. Our goal is to build a strong community of learners, parents and teaching professional.
            We have partnered with various organization to bring educational opprtunities to students in remote areas of the US and the Caribbean. 
            Join us on our mission by reaching out via our mailing list.
